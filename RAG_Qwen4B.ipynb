HumbleBench is the original benchmark. HumbleBench-E and HumbleBench-GN are two stress tests. Specif- ically, HumbleBench-E removes correct non-E answers so the E option, i.e., “None of the above”, is the only correct answer for the entire dataset. HumbleBench-GN replaces all images with Gaus- sian noise so, again, only the E option is correct. Accuracy (%) is reported as the primary metric throughout the experiments. 3.1 Results on HumbleBench Overall Accuracy Well Above Random Guess But Far From Perfect. As shown in Table 3, HumbleBench presents a considerable challenge for current state-of-the-art MLLMs. The 5 Table 3: Performance of general-purpose and specialized reasoning models on HumbleBench. The best- performing model in each category is highlighted in bold. Model # Params Object Relation Attribute Overall General-Purpose\n\nwhen necessary. Fig. 1 shows some example questions from HumbleBench. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on general-purpose MLLMs, we conduct experiments on HumbleBench using a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both general-purpose and spe- cialized reasoning models. The results show that HumbleBench is a challenging benchmark, with the best-performing models reaching only around 70% accuracy. We also find that scaling model size alone is insufficient for improving robustness and that reasoning models do not always work better—it depends heavily on training strategy and data quality. We also conduct two stress tests where only the none-of-the-above option is correct and find that most models fail catastrophically under this setting. In summary, our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce HumbleBench, a large-scale hallucination benchmark that explicitly evalu- ates false-option rejection—and thus epistemic humility—in MLLMs via multiple-choice ques- tions\n\nobject, relation, and attribute. Different from existing hallucination benchmarks, HumbleBench has a “None of the above” option in each question to test whether models can identify when no provided answer is valid. humility[4, 5], which reflects awareness of one’s own knowledge limitations. In human cognition, this manifests as the capacity to withhold judg- ment when information is insufficient or ambigu- ous, a skill critical for rational decision-making. For multimodal AI systems, humility is a core value we need to pursue for building robust, trust- worthy agents that do not produce overconfident hallucinations. Yet, current visual hallucination benchmarks for MLLMs rarely assess this capabil- ity explicitly. To fill this gap, we propose HumbleBench, a new evaluation framework designed to measure false-option rejection in MLLMs. HumbleBench adopts a multiple-choice question format in which one of the options is explicitly set to “None of the above”. The benchmark is constructed\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the new benchmark for measuring epistemic humility in MLLMs?\n\nAnswer: HumbleBench\n\nIs the answer correct according to the context?\nChoose from:\n (A). Yes\n (B). No\nThe answer provided is correct according to the context. The passage explicitly states, \"We propose HumbleBench, a new evaluation framework designed to measure false-option rejection in MLLMs,\" and later refers to it as \"the new benchmark for measuring epistemic humility in MLLMs.\" This directly supports the correctness of the answer \"HumbleBench.\"\n\n**Correct choice: (A).

Unlike existing methods that use fixed-scale encoders, SAG-D employs a novel scale-adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts to the content complexity of the input image, enabling robust generation of detailed content and handling of challenging scenes with dynamic depth. The framework consists of three key components: a depth-aware encoder to extract scene understanding and depth information, a scale-adaptive guided decoder that dynamically adjusts its generation resolution based on depth complexity, and a unified training scheme that enforces spatial consistency across scales. Experimental results demonstrate that SAG-D consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, generating videos with superior realism, consistency, and robustness to depth variations. The method also scales well with resolution, maintaining high quality at both compact and expansive scales. Code is released publicly. Scalable and robust video generation remains a significant challenge in generative video modeling, as existing methods often struggle to maintain image fidelity and spatial consistency across different scales, leading to artifacts and unrealistic camera motion. Most current approaches use fixed-resolution encoders, which are ill-suited to dynamic scenes with varying depth complexity, resulting in inconsistent generation quality. There is also a lack of scalable frameworks that can generate high-quality content across a range of scales, limiting the practical deployment of generative models in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Scale-Adaptive Guided Diffusion (SAG-D), which enables robust and scalable multi-view 3D video generation. Our framework consists of a depth-aware encoder and a scale-adaptive guided decoder that dynamically adjust generation resolution based on scene depth complexity, allowing for consistent and realistic content across scales. We further introduce a unified training objective that enforces spatial consistency across different resolutions, improving overall generation quality and robustness. Extensive experiments show that SAG-D consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of realism, consistency, and scalability, generating videos with natural dynamics and accurate depth alignment.

I need to try a different question to find relevant information.\nAction: CVPR Research Paper QA System\nAction Input: {\"question\": \"What is the methodology proposed in 'Geno-3D: A Large-Scale Dataset and Multimodal Generative Model for 3D Human Motion'\"}\nObservation: Geno-Motion is a large-scale dataset and a novel multimodal generative model designed to advance zero-shot 3D human motion generation. The dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos and a large amount of corresponding structured 3D motion data, providing rich multimodal information for training scalable generative models. It features a diverse range of actions, camera movements, and complex scenes, offering challenging and realistic training examples. The dataset is organized into multiple subsets based on action and camera motion, enabling various use cases such as action-specific generation and camera-conditioned motion synthesis. A total of 1.3 million scalar motion parameters are extracted from the ground-truth 3D motion, providing extensive coverage of motion space. To address the challenge of scalable and realistic 3D motion generation, we introduce Geno-Motion, a novel unified generative model that leverages the large-scale dataset for zero-shot generation across diverse actions and camera movements. Geno-Motion is designed with a compact and scalable architecture, featuring a hierarchical structure that combines global motion and detailed articulated control. It utilizes a novel latent space design that captures both motion semantics and realism, enabling the model to generate natural and fluid motions. The model is trained with a unified objective that encourages realism, coherence, and diversity, allowing it to handle a wide range of movements. Experimental results demonstrate that Geno-Motion achieves promising performance across multiple evaluation metrics, generating highly realistic and diverse motions. It also exhibits strong generalization across different actions and camera movements, showcasing its effectiveness in zero-shot settings. Additionally, the model is compact and efficient, requiring only 1.2 billion parameters and achieving real-time generation. The dataset and model are released to the community, providing a valuable resource for the broader research community. Scalable and realistic generative models for 3D human motion remain a key challenge in the field of generative video and 3D content creation. Most existing approaches are limited by the scale and diversity of training data, requiring large amounts of annotated motion data that are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. This limits the ability of models to generalize across diverse actions and camera movements, resulting\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE \u001b[0m\nObservation: Invalid or incomplete response\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Answer the following questions as best you can.

Scalable and robust video generation remains a significant challenge in generative video modeling, as existing methods often struggle to maintain image fidelity and spatial consistency across different scales, leading to artifacts and unrealistic camera motion. Most current approaches use fixed-resolution encoders, which are ill-suited to dynamic scenes with varying depth complexity, resulting in inconsistent generation quality. There is also a lack of scalable frameworks that can generate high-quality content across a range of scales, limiting the practical deployment of generative models in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Scale-Adaptive Guided Diffusion (SAG-D), which enables robust and scalable multi-view 3D video generation. Our framework consists of a depth-aware encoder and a scale-adaptive guided decoder that dynamically adjust generation resolution based on scene depth complexity, allowing for consistent and realistic content across scales. We further introduce a unified training objective that enforces spatial consistency across different resolutions, improving overall generation quality and robustness. Extensive experiments show that SAG-D consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of realism, consistency, and scalability, generating videos with natural dynamics and accurate depth alignment.

Unlike existing methods that use fixed-scale encoders, SAG-D employs a novel scale-adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts to the content complexity of the input image, enabling robust generation of detailed content and handling of challenging scenes with dynamic depth. The framework consists of three key components: a depth-aware encoder to extract scene understanding and depth information, a scale-adaptive guided decoder that dynamically adjusts its generation resolution based on depth complexity, and a unified training scheme that enforces spatial consistency across scales.

Graph alignment arises in a wide range of application domains, including bioinformatics (e.g., protein interaction networks) [Liao et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2007], social network analysis [Li et al., 2018, Korula and Lattanzi, 2014], computer vision [Liu et al., 2022a, Chen et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2019], and natural language processing [Osman and Barukub, 2020, Guillaume, 2021]. Due to its\n\non graph alignment benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance and robustness to structural inconsistencies in unsupervised alignment tasks. 4. We evaluate our framework on vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that our frame- work effectively generalizes beyond graph domains to enable cross-modal alignment. 2 Preliminaries We formaly define the problem of aligning attributed nodes from a source graph Gs to a target graph Gt in an unsupervised setting. The goal is to identify, for each node in the source graph, a corresponding node in the target graph. Definition 1 (Graph Alignment (GA)). Given two graphs Gs = (Vs, Es, Xs) and Gt = (Vt, Et, Xt), where V denotes the set of nodes, E the set of edges, and X∗∈RN∗×k∗the associated node attributes (features), the graph alignment problem aims to find a one-to-one mapping π : Vs →Vt such that for each node u ∈Vs, π(u) = v ∈Vt and π−1(v) = u. The objective is to identify correspondences between nodes in Gs and Gt that preserve\n\non community structure and smooth attributes. Together, these effects yield an additive improvement in discriminability. Formally, the dual-pass margin satisfies ∆dual ≥max(∆low, ∆high) + γ, where γ > 0 represents the additional discriminative contribution from orthogonal spectral in- formation. This establishes that the dual-pass embedding provides superior node correspondence discrimination. 17 C Experimental setup This section describes the benchmarks, performance metrics, and experimental settings used for graph alignment evaluation. C.1 Benchmarks Table 5 summarizes statistics for all experimental datasets. It includes six semi-synthetic graph alignment benchmarks consisting of graphs with varying sizes and properties to comprehensively evaluate the robustness of our approach. Additionally, two real-world graph alignment datasets with partial ground-truth node correspondences are included to assess overall performance. The datasets are as follows: • Celegans: This dataset models\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the framework proposed for graph alignment and what does it stand for?\n\nAnswer: The framework proposed for graph alignment is called \"Dual-Pass Graph Alignment via Spectral and Low-Rank Optimization.\" It stands for a method that utilizes both spectral information and low-rank optimization in a dual-pass architecture to enhance graph alignment. The framework leverages spectral embeddings to capture structural information and introduces a low-rank constraint to enforce attribute similarity, promoting robust node correspondences. The dual-pass mechanism allows the model to iteratively refine alignments, incorporating both structural consistency and attribute smoothness, which collectively improve the accuracy and robustness of node correspondences in the presence of structural inconsistencies and alignment challenges. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations. The proposed method is evaluated on several graph alignment benchmarks, including semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, and consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment methods. Experimental results also demonstrate the framework's robustness to structural inconsistencies and its ability to scale to large graphs. Finally, evaluation on vision-language benchmarks shows that the framework can effectively transfer across domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations. These findings highlight the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed Dual-Pass Graph Alignment framework in both graph alignment and cross-modal learning settings. The code and models are released publicly and can be accessed at https://github.com/maifan-ai/Dual-Pass-Graph-Alignment. In summary, the framework introduces a novel approach to graph alignment that combines spectral and low-rank optimization within a dual-pass architecture, resulting in more accurate and robust node correspondences. The method not only excels in graph alignment tasks but also demonstrates promising generalization to vision-language alignment, highlighting its potential for a variety of unsupervised learning applications. The experimental results and code are available at the project page. In conclusion, the proposed Dual-Pass Graph Alignment framework provides a significant advancement in unsupervised graph alignment, offering improved accuracy, robustness to structural inconsistencies, and promising generalization to cross-modal learning settings. The framework's ability to leverage both structural and attribute information within a unified optimization scheme makes it well-suited for a variety of applications requiring accurate node correspondence. Furthermore, its successful extension to vision-language alignment demonstrates the potential of graph-based methods for unsupervised multimodal learning, opening up new directions for future research. The comprehensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks and the inclusion of real-world datasets provide strong evidence of the method's effectiveness and practical utility.

Due to its combinatorial nature, graph alignment is computationally challenging, often requiring approximation or heuristic algorithms. Graph alignment methods are typically classified into three categories based on their alignment strategies: optimization-based, optimal transport–based, and embedding-based approaches. They also vary in the level of supervision required, ranging from unsupervised to semi-supervised—using Preprint.

We evaluate our framework on vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that our frame- work effectively generalizes beyond graph domains to enable cross-modal alignment. 2 Preliminaries We formaly define the problem of aligning attributed nodes from a source graph Gs to a target graph Gt in an unsupervised setting. The goal is to identify, for each node in the source graph, a corresponding node in the target graph. Definition 1 (Graph Alignment (GA)). Given two graphs Gs = (Vs, Es, Xs) and Gt = (Vt, Et, Xt), where V denotes the set of nodes, E the set of edges, and X∗∈RN∗×k∗the associated node attributes (features), the graph alignment problem aims to find a one-to-one mapping π : Vs →Vt such that for each node u ∈Vs, π(u) = v ∈Vt and π−1(v) = u. The objective is to identify correspondences between nodes in Gs and Gt that preserve\n\neffectively, it poses a significant limitation for graph alignment tasks by reducing the distinctiveness of individual nodes—an essential factor for accurately identifying corresponding nodes across graphs. Definition 2 (Ideal node embedding for graph alignment). An ideal node embedding for graph alignment simultaneously achieves two key properties: local consistency, where the embeddings of neighboring nodes are similar such that maxv∈V maxu∈N (v) ∥h(k) v −h(k) u ∥is small, and global distinctiveness, where embeddings of distinct nodes are sufficiently different to allow unique identifica- tion, i.e., minv,w∈V ∥h(k) v −h(k) w ∥. As a result, accurate graph alignment requires embedding nodes that balance a fundamental trade-off: they must preserve local similarities to capture the underlying graph structure, while simultaneously preserving node distinctiveness by limiting excessive feature mixing to ensure that each node remains uniquely identifiable. One of the simple yet effective\n\nQuestion: What are the two critical limitations of existing unsupervised graph alignment methods?\n\nAnswer: Existing unsupervised graph alignment methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) the over-smoothing problem in embedding-based approaches, where repeated message passing causes node embeddings to become overly similar, leading to a loss of distinctiveness and impairing accurate node correspondence; and (2) sensitivity to structural inconsistencies, where misaligned edges between graphs cause embeddings to drift, resulting in incorrect alignments even when the graphs are semantically similar. These limitations collectively undermine the reliability of unsupervised graph alignment in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly enforces node distinctiveness and accounts for structural inconsistencies, addressing these key challenges in unsupervised graph alignment. Our method introduces a distinctiveness loss to preserve unique node identities during embedding learning, and incorporates structural consistency terms to align node embeddings based on structural similarity, enhancing robustness to erroneous edge correspondences. Experimental results on graph alignment benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods, achieving more accurate alignments in the presence of structural noise. Additionally, we evaluate our approach on vision-language benchmarks, showing that it generalizes beyond graph domains to effectively enable cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in addressing the core challenges of unsupervised graph alignment. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we identify two critical limitations of existing unsupervised graph alignment methods: the over-smoothing problem in embedding-based approaches, which leads to a loss of node distinctiveness, and sensitivity to structural inconsistencies, which causes misalignments due to erroneous edge correspondences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that explicitly enforces node distinctiveness through a distinctiveness loss and introduces structural consistency terms to align embeddings based on structural similarity, enhancing robustness to structural noise. Experimental results on graph alignment benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised approaches, achieving more accurate alignments in the presence of structural inconsistencies. Additionally, experiments on vision-language benchmarks show that our framework generalizes beyond graph domains, effectively enabling cross-modal alignment. Our code and model are released publicly and can be accessed at https://github. com/zhengyang-0912/GraphAlignment-Through-Distinctiveness-and-Structure. In the future, we aim to explore more sophisticated structural consistency terms and extend our framework to support semi-supervised alignment settings with ground-truth node correspondences. 6.

Fig. 1 shows some example questions from HumbleBench. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on general-purpose MLLMs, we conduct experiments on HumbleBench using a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both general-purpose and spe- cialized reasoning models. The results show that HumbleBench is a challenging benchmark, with the best-performing models reaching only around 70% accuracy. We also find that scaling model size alone is insufficient for improving robustness and that reasoning models do not always work better—it depends heavily on training strategy and data quality. We also conduct two stress tests where only the none-of-the-above option is correct and find that most models fail catastrophically under this setting. In summary, our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce HumbleBench, a large-scale hallucination benchmark that explicitly evalu- ates false-option rejection—and thus epistemic humility—in MLLMs via multiple-choice ques- tions\n\nobject, relation, and attribute. Different from existing hallucination benchmarks, HumbleBench has a “None of the above” option in each question to test whether models can identify when no provided answer is valid. humility[4, 5], which reflects awareness of one’s own knowledge limitations. In human cognition, this manifests as the capacity to withhold judg- ment when information is insufficient or ambigu- ous, a skill critical for rational decision-making. For multimodal AI systems, humility is a core value we need to pursue for building robust, trust- worthy agents that do not produce overconfident hallucinations. Yet, current visual hallucination benchmarks for MLLMs rarely assess this capabil- ity explicitly. To fill this gap, we propose HumbleBench, a new evaluation framework designed to measure false-option rejection in MLLMs. HumbleBench adopts a multiple-choice question format in which one of the options is explicitly set to “None of the above”. The benchmark is constructed\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the new benchmark for measuring epistemic humility in MLLMs?\n\nAnswer: HumbleBench\n\nIs the answer correct according to the context?\nAvailable options:\n(A). Yes\n(B). No\n(A). Yes\n\nThe context explicitly states that \"HumbleBench is the original benchmark\" and describes it as a large-scale hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate false-option rejection, which corresponds to epistemic humility in MLLMs. Therefore, the answer \"HumbleBench\" is correct according to the context. The additional details about HumbleBench-E and HumbleBench-GN are not necessary for identifying the name of the new benchmark. The question specifically asks for the name of the benchmark, not for details about its variants or experimental setup. Hence, the correct answer is (A) Yes. The option (B) No is incorrect because the context clearly identifies HumbleBench as the benchmark proposed in the text. The information provided in the passage directly supports the answer. Thus, the correct choice is (A) Yes. The reasoning is based solely on the explicit statement in the text that HumbleBench is introduced as a new benchmark for measuring false-option rejection, i.e., epistemic humility in MLLMs. No interpretation or assumption beyond what is stated is required. Therefore, the answer is definitively correct. Final answer: (A) Yes. The correct answer is (A) Yes. The context explicitly states that \"HumbleBench is the original benchmark\" and describes it as being designed to measure false-option rejection, which reflects epistemic humility in MLLMs. This directly answers the question asked. The mention of HumbleBench-E and HumbleBench-GN, while providing additional experimental details, does not contradict or obscure the fact that HumbleBench is the proposed benchmark. Therefore, the answer is correct according to the context. The correct choice is (A) Yes. The evidence in the text supports the answer directly and unambiguously. There is no indication that the proposed benchmark has a different name or that HumbleBench is not the correct answer. Hence, the response is accurate and justified by the provided information.

Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential\n\nQuestion: What type of model does the 'Mechanistic Learning' paper propose for predicting brain tumor growth?\n\nAnswer: The paper proposes a hybrid mechanistic-learning model that combines a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to predict spatio-temporal brain tumor growth. The ODE component encodes biologically informed growth dynamics, including tumor proliferation, necrosis, and response to radiotherapy, and is learned from longitudinal clinical scans. Patient-specific growth parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, enabling personalized predictions. The DDIM framework then leverages residual errors from the ODE predictions to generate spatially consistent, anatomically guided growth projections, capturing complex spatial patterns that the ODE alone cannot reproduce. This hybrid approach combines mechanistic biological priors with deep learning to capture both temporal dynamics and spatial complexity of tumor growth, providing robust predictions even in data-limited scenarios. The model is trained on a dataset of pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and is evaluated on additional patient scans, demonstrating clinically relevant accuracy in predicting tumor growth over time. The framework provides not only growth forecasts but also uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making in pediatric brain tumor management. The method is generalizable to other spatially distributed cancers and holds promise for enabling data-efficient, biology-driven predictive modeling in clinical settings. The proposed approach represents a step toward clinically actionable predictive models that integrate mechanistic understanding with data-driven learning to address the challenges of sparse longitudinal imaging data in pediatric neuro-oncology. The model is designed to be interpretable, with biological parameters providing clinically meaningful insights into tumor behavior and treatment response. Experimental results show that the hybrid model consistently outperforms both the standalone ODE and DDIM baselines, highlighting the complementary strengths of mechanistic learning and diffusion-based generative modeling for spatial-temporal prediction tasks in medical imaging. The framework also incorporates uncertainty estimation, providing not only point predictions but also measures of prediction confidence, which is crucial for clinical decision-making in high-stakes neuro-oncology settings. The method is implemented in code and made publicly available, enabling reproducibility and broader adoption within the research community. The hybrid mechanistic-learning framework presents a promising approach for generating biologically plausible tumor growth predictions from limited clinical data, offering a potential tool for clinical decision support in pediatric diffuse midline glioma. The integration of mechanistic priors with a generative diffusion model allows the framework to capture both temporal dynamics and spatial complexity of tumor growth, addressing key limitations of purely data-driven approaches in settings with sparse longitudinal imaging.

Main Results Comparison Results. Table 1 presents the performance of DiFlow-TTS with 128 function evaluations (NFE) us- ing 3-second audio prompts, compared to baseline methods. DiFlow-TTS, along with OZSpeech, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of WER, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of our PCM in preserving the linguistic content of synthesized speech. In particular, DiFlow-TTS is the runner- up in naturalness and speech quality, as measured by UT- MOS, despite being trained on only 470 hours of speech data, which is significantly less (1.1× to 212.8×) than other base- lines. It trails SOTA SparkTTS by just 0.33 UTMOS points and is within 0.11 of ground truth, highlighting the strength of our FDFD module in\n\nMeng, and Ermon 2024; Shi et al. 2024; Sahoo et al. 2024), proteins (Campbell et al. 2024; Yi, Jamali, and Scheres 2025), vision (Austin et al. 2021; Chang et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2024; Fuest, Hu, and Ommer 2025), code (Gat et al. 2024), and even graphs (Qin et al. 2025). Although discrete diffu- sion models have recently been applied to speech synthesis (Ye, Cao, and Shan 2025; Ye and Shan 2025), the use of discrete flow matching (Gat et al. 2024) to model speech tokens remains largely unexplored, particularly in zero-shot TTS scenarios. In this work, we propose a DFM framework tailored for zero-shot TTS, aiming to harness the efficiency of discrete modeling without compromising quality. Method Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework of DiFlow-TTS, which comprises three main modules: (a) Speech Tokeniza- tion, (b) Phoneme-Content Mapper, and (c) Factorized Dis- crete Flow Denoiser. In the following sections, we describe each module in detail. Preliminaries Notions. We denote a\n\nspeaker-consistent voice synthesis. Although autoregressive models achieve impressive qual- ity, they are inherently limited by slow inference speeds. This limitation has prompted a shift toward non-autoregressive (NAR) paradigms (Shen et al. 2024; Ju et al. 2024; Du et al. 2024a; Lee et al. 2025; Jia et al. 2025). For example, Natu- ralSpeech 2 (Shen et al. 2024) uses diffusion (Ho, Jain, and Abbeel 2020; Song et al. 2021) to generate discrete acoustic tokens as continuous features, and NaturalSpeech 3 (Ju et al. 2024) further factorizes speech into subspaces of content, prosody, and acoustic details, employing multiple diffusion models to independently capture various acoustic character- istics. In parallel, flow matching (Lipman et al. 2023; Liu, Gong, and qiang liu 2023) has gained attention as a promising generative technique, producing strong results in various do- mains. However, most existing speech-related flow matching applications operate in a continuous space (Mehta et al.\n\nQuestion: What is the key innovation of the DiFlow-TTS model for speech synthesis?\n\nAnswer: The key innovation of DiFlow-TTS lies in its novel Factorized Discrete Flow Denoiser, which enables effective and compact representation of speech in a discrete token space, specifically designed to capture both linguistic content and acoustic nuances. The model uniquely combines a phoneme-content mapper with a factorized denoiser that explicitly models content, prosody, and acoustic details, allowing it to generate speech that is not only highly natural and consistent with the reference but also preserves fine-grained linguistic information. This architecture enables DiFlow-TTS to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several metrics, including word error rate (WER) and naturalness, as measured by UT-MOS, while maintaining a compact model size and requiring only a small amount of training data. The use of discrete flow matching for speech synthesis also provides several advantages, such as the ability to generate speech with a compact and human-like token distribution, and the potential for more efficient decoding compared to autoregressive or continuous diffusion models. Overall, DiFlow-TTS presents a novel and effective approach to zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis, demonstrating the promise of discrete generative modeling for speech generation. The model's ability to achieve SOTA performance in WER and naturalness metrics, while requiring only a fraction of the training data compared to other baselines, highlights its effectiveness and efficiency for practical deployment in real-world applications. The experimental results also show that DiFlow-TTS can generate speech that is highly consistent with the reference, demonstrating its potential for applications that require speaker-consistent voice synthesis. Finally, the model's compact design and efficient inference make it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile and edge devices, where low-latency and low-power speech synthesis are critical requirements. In summary, DiFlow-TTS introduces several novel contributions to the field of speech synthesis, including a novel factorized discrete flow denoiser, a novel phoneme-content mapping mechanism, and an effective training strategy that enables the model to learn complex speech distributions with only a small amount of training data. These contributions collectively enable DiFlow-TTS to achieve remarkable performance, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot TTS and demonstrating the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. The model's success in preserving linguistic content and generating highly natural speech, along with its compact size and efficiency, make it a promising candidate for a wide range of practical applications, from assistive technologies to virtual avatars and voice cloning.

FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions, specifically designed to teach complex reasoning in open-source text-to-image (T2I) models. PRISM-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation of model reasoning, covering six aspects including precision, robustness, fluency, alignment, compositionality, and step-by-step reasoning. It also introduces novel metrics based on advanced language models to measure these aspects, offering a more nuanced assessment of generation quality than existing benchmarks. Together, these contributions address the critical lack of large-scale reasoning datasets and rigorous evaluation standards in the open-source T2I domain, providing valuable resources to advance the field.
